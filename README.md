### Web Science 1

-> Designed a combined news and social media system, where news along with its relevant tweets on the news topic are presented
-> Identified and crawled public reaction to BBC news and other emerging events from tweets
-> Designed an A/B testing procedure for incremental development
-> Designed a crowdsourcing-based evaluation

### Web Science 2

-> Collected and analyzed Reddit data and identifed mental health issues in the population based on subreddits using Topic Modelling.

-> Created a transport alert system exploiting Twitter data by using Geolocalisation. Analysed the distribution of data by organising the tweets into grids of 1km x 1km and identified potential biases.Also, tested the effectiveness of the model for non-geo tagged data-set.

### Web Science 3

-> Performed Event Detection by collecting data from Twitter streams and organizing them as groups. Reduced cost of detecting entities, used tf-idf concepts to capture data, removed spam groups and identified categories of events.
-> Designed a crowdsourcing based design to capture ground truth and understand the effectiveness of the system developed.

### Web Science 4

-> Used Gensim library tweet's text data. Identified issues with short text topic modelling and group tweets based on different criterias like content and type of users and compared the performance.
